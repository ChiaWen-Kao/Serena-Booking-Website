# Serena Activity Booking Website
A user-centered web platform promoting accessible, local wellness activities to support mental health and community connection.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This wellness-focused website helps users discover local activities, manage stress, and build meaningful connections through affordable or free events. Designed for individuals seeking a balanced lifestyle, the platform offers intuitive navigation, community engagement tools, and accessible design for users with mild vision impairments.


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose
This project was completed as part of the DECO7140 â€“ Introduction to Web Design course at The University of Queensland. It was created in response to a real-world client brief by combining UX research, WCAG accessibility standards, frontend design, and API integration best practices to deliver a meaningful, inclusive user experience.

## ðŸ§  Project Approach
### UX Research
- Developed three user personas based on the client brief to identify user pain points, emotional goals, and contextual needs
- Applied WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines, including high contrast ratios, readable fonts, and color-blind-safe palettes

### Implementation
- Frontend Development: Built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as per project requirements (no frontend frameworks)
- API Integration: Integrated with a course-provided API for activities and comments; for demonstration purposes, static content is used due to the API being private and no longer available

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
1. Event Discovery: Advanced search bar with filters for location, date, budget, and theme, along with geolocation-based nearby activities
2. Event Booking: Users can directly book events through the platform
3. User Reviews: A review section helps users make informed decisions about activities
4. Community Connection: Online chat feature for connecting with like-minded individuals
